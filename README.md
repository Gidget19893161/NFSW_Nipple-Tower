## Feedback
This is a work in process. There for i know there are bugs and probably lost of them and i am sure when the project is "done" there will still be bugs. I am sure there are better ways of doing what I have done. I am open for constructive critiscm and in fact I hope that i get some. That is how we all learn. However, please do not be rude. I am learning and hoping I can get other people onboard with the project that knows more than me to teach me and help out where needed or where they can.

## The Goal
I have a very simple goal, to be able to control a linear actuator and push up some clover clamps attached to nipples.
